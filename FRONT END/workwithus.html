		<p>Millions of underprivileged children in India are deprived of their basic rights. They are unable to complete their education, are subjected to abuse, and forced into labour at a tender age. Since its inception, <i>Light of Hope</i> has been working towards tackling these issues. An inevitable contribution to this cause comes from the persistent efforts of the <i>our volunteers</i>. These self-motivated individuals understand the need to get involved with this cause. Light Of Hope offers a diverse range of volunteering opportunities. Through these, you can not only contribute towards the betterment of underprivileged children, but also undergo a transformational journey for yourselves!</p>
